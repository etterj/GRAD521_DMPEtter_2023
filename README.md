Data Management Plan for GRAD521

Context for the DMP: 
    The premise of my project is related to the association between oxylipins and cognitive
function in Parkinson’s disease patients. Oxylipins are generated by the oxidation of polyunsaturated
fatty acids, which are commonly found in fat tissues and plasma. Oxidation results in damage to many
different systems throughout the body, including the formation of oxylipins and the formation of
Lewy bodies. Lewy body formation is known to be associated with several neurodegenerative
diseases including Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Lewy Body Dementia (LBD).
With this in mind, it is plausible that an association between oxylipins in the plasma and the
presence of PD/LBD can be determined. If we can successfully use select oxygenated lipids as
biomarkers for inflammation in these patients, this could be critical information for the future
development of new symptom treatments for Parkinson’s disease. The goal of my research project is
to explore any potential associations between oxylipin concentrations in human plasma, and the
presence of PD. Eventually, the goal is to apply this oxylipin test for early diagnosis of PD before
irreversible symptoms set in.
