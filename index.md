## Data Description
### Type of Data Being Collected
I will be collecting information regarding the concentration of a variety of oxylipins. I will also need to keep track
of the various samples being analyzed, and any relevant metadata pertaining to the analysis (such as
instrument/method parameters, system temperature, flow rates, etc). While the samples are from
humans, our lab is not facilitating the collection of the samples and all human samples will have been
de-identified prior to analysis. The raw data output will be in the form of graphs and/or datasheets.
One set of output data will be generated for each sample (the exact number of samples being analyzed is currently unknown).

For each sample, the following data will be collected:
● Data output graphs (2)
● Metadata from analysis (temperature, instrument parameters)
● Sample metadata (identifier, volume, concentration, preparation date)

## Roles and Responsibilities
In the research project, I will primarily perform data collection and analysis responsibilities, 
including data and metadata generation, data analysis, and data organization. The PI will be 
responsible for the management procedures, including protection of sensitive data (when 
applicable), data preservation, access control, and enforcement of the DMP. The Research 
Associate has traditionally been the main contact for instrument maintenance, quality control and 
software development/maintenance. I plan on continuing to rely on them for the maintenance and 
quality control aspects of the project. While I do not anticipate anyone leaving the research 
group, in the event that someone does leave, the PI will determine who will take on the 
responsibilities

## Storage and Security
### Data Storage
The data I will be handling as part of this research project is not considered sensitive or 
confidential according to OSU’s definitions. All samples will have been de-identified prior to 
being received by the lab. As far as I am aware, the data being collected will not need to be 
protected.

During the project, the raw data will be stored locally on the computer in the lab that is 
attached to the mass spectrometry system. Additional copies of raw and processed data will be 
kept in my Google Drive and OneDrive, and the PI will also retain a copy of all processed data.
Any physical data will be kept in a folder with my lab notebook to prevent loss or damage of the 
prints. If ever applicable, sensitive data or other data that needs to be protected will be stored in 
Box. In total, a minimum of 4 copies of processed data will be stored among different computers 
and operating systems to ensure that, in the event of a software failure, the data will not be lost. 
    
### Contingency Plan
To ensure that any data associated with my ONID account (including Google Drive and 
OneDrive) will not be lost upon my graduation, I will make sure the PI has a copy of all raw and 
processed data that was once stored on my account. My lab notebook and any physical printed 
data will also remain in the lab
